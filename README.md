## How to run locally
First, you will want to start the server:

```
npm run start-server
```

This will deploy the API locally to port 3001.

Second, you will want to start the React application via webpack-dev-server:

```
npm start
```

This application is a simple demo. Next steps would include:
  - Implementing a proper test suite (Ignored for brevity)
  - Migrating the data access into a state manager like Redux and Redux-saga (Unnecessary at this current level of complexity)
